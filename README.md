# How To Play Zombie Dice
### A quick concole game.


## Overview
Zombie Dice is a quick and easy game. The basic idea of the game is that the players are zombies
which aim to eat as many brains as they can without being shot. It can be played with 2 to 8 players.
The first player who gets 13 brains is the winner!

## Dice
You need 13 dice to play the game. The dice should have 6 sides with pictures on them. The pictures can be: 
* Brains :boy: - You should get as many as you can of these.
* Footsteps :feet: - You should avoid them. If you get 3 of these in a single turn, you will lose all of the brains you ate in this turn.
* Shotguns :boom: - You can roll this die again.
The dice are colured in 3 different colours. There are 6 green dice, 4 yellow dice and 3 red dice.
1. Green dice - They are the most favourable because there are less shotgun symbols on them.
2. Yellow dice - If you roll a yellow dice, you have equal probability of getting one of the different symbols.
3. Red dice - They are the most unfavourable. They have the most shotgun symbols and you risk being shot.

## Rules
The first player grabs 3 dice and rolls them. If he gets brains or shotgun, he puts these dice aside to keep track of the current brains score and the accumulated shotguns. If a player gets 3 shotguns during his turn, he loses all of the brains he has eaten and does not score anything from this turn. After a player rolls and he doesn't end being shot, he may choose to roll again and possibly score more brains. He gets the dice that rolled to steps in the previous roll and draws more dice from the die pool to add up to 3. But if he chooses to pass, the other player in turn takes 3 dice and tries his luck. The first one who gets 13 dice is the one who wins the game !! :trophy:
